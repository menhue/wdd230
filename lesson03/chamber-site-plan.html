            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>This website will provide the  local businesses with a much-needed platform to expand their reach and gain international visibility.
                 By addressing the historical difficulties locals have faced in accessing broader markets, this platform could play a significant 
                 role in fostering economic growth and empowering local businesses to thrive both nationally and internationally. 
                 It's clear that the website will act as a bridge, effectively connecting local products and services to a global audience,
                  which can significantly boost their market potential and visibility.</p>
